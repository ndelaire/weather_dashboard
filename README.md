## Project Overview 

Purpose of this project is to create a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API. When a user searches a city, the application populates the current city weather as well as a five day forecast. Included in the forecast is temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. On the five day forecast, it displaces the date, the temperature, and the humidity. The application will also store the cities in local storage so the user can reference past searches.
